 * @summary (New string split method) The split method in the String class
 *          returns an array of strings consisting of the substrings split by
 *          the delimiters. However, the delimiters are not returned. Implement
 *          the following new method that returns an array of strings consisting
 *          of the substrings split by the matching delimiter, including the
 *          matching delimiter. You do not need to worry about the case of
 *          multiple delimiters.
 * 
 *          public static String[] split(String s, String regex)
 * 
 *          For example, split("ab#12#453", "#") returns ab, #, 12, #, 453 in an
 *          array of String. split("ab#12#453#", "#") returns ab, #, 12, #, 453,
 *          # in an array of String
